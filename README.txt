This repository consists of two fairly simple classes which can be used to create a simple login gui with hashed password functionality
The HashedPassword class enables the creation of a password object which utilizes an MD5 hashing algorith.
The HashedPasswordLogin class creates a gui in which the user can create a username and PW(stored in a file on the local machine) and log in using a created password.
